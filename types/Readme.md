# types sample

An example demonstrating how to annotate the code with JSDoc tags
to provide type annotations to the compiler. See also
[Annotating JavaScript for the Closure Compiler](https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/docs/js-for-compiler).

Try to comment out the lines below the comment `types errors` in
`src/main.js` to see the type error messages that the compiler outputs.

To build the project, run:

    make build

This compiles the source file `src/main.js` to `dist/app.js`.

To launch the development server, run:

    make serve

And then open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).
