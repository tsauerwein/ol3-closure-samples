# simple sample

A simple setup for using the Google Closure Compiler with
[closure-util](https://github.com/openlayers/closure-util),
which demonstrates function inlining and dead-code removal.

To build the project, run:

    make build

This compiles the source file `src/main.js` to `dist/app.js`.

To launch the development server, run:

    make serve

And then open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).
