# OpenLayers 3 simple sample

This example shows a configuration for a simple application using
OpenLayers. See also the tutorial [Compiling Application with Closure Compiler](http://openlayers.org/en/latest/doc/tutorials/closure.html).

To build the project, run:

    make build

This compiles the source file `src/main.js` to `dist/app.js`.

To launch the development server, run:

    make serve

And then open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).
